# Caesar cypher challenge.
A short Caesar Cypher Encoder / Decoder

Objective was to create the shortest encoder / decoder.
This was an optional task during my first week at Maker's Academy.
The cipher is hard-coded to a three letter shift.
Got it down to 2 lines, although second isn't very clear at all.
The rotate is unnecessary but helps human understanding of A = 1, B = 2 etc.
Also available  is single method encoder/decoder that takes a string and a boolean indicating ifEncoding
